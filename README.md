In this Project we will scrap TMDB website: https://www.themoviedb.org/tv and extract a list of popular TV shows and some related information about TV shows.

It involves following main steps.

Making an HTTP request to a server and loading the web page https://www.themoviedb.org/tv using request Library
Inspecting the HTML code of page
Identifying the data we want to extract
parsing the websiteâ€™s code using BeautifulSoup library
Extracting the list of shows from the main page. For each page, we'll get the
show name, user rating, Show's URL and release date
And finally transefering the extracted data into a CSV file using pandas library.
